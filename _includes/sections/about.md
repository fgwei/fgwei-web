## Research
    
My main research interests are in the areas of computer networks and security with emphasis on:

    <div class="col-sm-12" markdown="1">

- `Applying static analysis for Android security vetting`: The focus is on detecting security issues on Android application. 
A large portion of those issues can be resolved by addressing one core problem – capturing semantic behaviors of the app 
such as object points-to and control-/data-flow information. 
Thus, we designed an approach to conducting static analysis for vetting Android apps, 
and built a generic framework, called [Amandroid](http://pag.arguslab.org/argus-saf/), 
which does inter-component, flow-/context-sensitive data flow analysis. 
Based on [Amandroid](http://pag.arguslab.org/argus-saf/), 
we applied certain security applications on popular Android apps, and the results shows that the tool 
is capable of finding real security issues and efficient enough in terms of analysis time. 
Our research paper is accepted by [CCS 2014](http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2014/). 
(Working with [Dr.Xinming (Simon) Ou](http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~xou/), [Dr.Robby](http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~robby/), 
[Dr.Sankardas Roy](http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~sroy/))

- Based upon Amandroid work to design a comprehensive Android application analysis tool chain.
Then, apply it into domains like: vulnerability finding, malware detection, etc.
The current open source tools including: [Argus-SAF](https://github.com/arguslab/Argus-SAF) (Amandroid is a submodule),
Argus-CIT (code inspection IDE plugin for [eclipse](https://github.com/fgwei/argus-cit) and 
[intellij](https://github.com/arguslab/argus-cit-intellij)), 
[jawa-compiler](https://github.com/arguslab/jawa-compiler), [jawa2java](https://github.com/arguslab/jawa2java).

- Android malware categorization and landscape study. 
By utilizing the tool chains I built during last couple years, 
I perform a large-scale landscape study to revealing the new threats and evolving trends of Android malware.
