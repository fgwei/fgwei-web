I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of South Florida,
and honored to be advised by [Dr.Xinming (Simon) Ou](http://www.cse.usf.edu/~xou/).
Furthermore, I am a member of [Argus CyberSecurity Lab](http://www.arguslab.org/). 

## Research


My main research interests are in the areas of computer networks and security with emphasis on:

- `Applying static analysis for Android security vetting`: The focus is on detecting security issues on Android application. 
A large portion of those issues can be resolved by addressing one core problem â€“ capturing semantic behaviors of the app 
such as object points-to and control-/data-flow information. 
Thus, we designed an approach to conducting static analysis for vetting Android apps, 
and built a generic framework, called [Amandroid](http://pag.arguslab.org/argus-saf/), 
which does inter-component, flow-/context-sensitive data flow analysis. 
Based on [Amandroid](http://pag.arguslab.org/argus-saf/), 
we applied certain security applications on popular Android apps, and the results shows that the tool 
is capable of finding real security issues and efficient enough in terms of analysis time. 
Our research paper is accepted by [CCS 2014](http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2014/).
